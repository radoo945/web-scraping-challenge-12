# Unit 12 Homework: Mission to Mars

In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following information outlines what you need to do.

## Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `web-scraping-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for the web scraping challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the challenge: `Missions_to_Mars`.

4. Add your notebook files to this folder as well as your Flask app.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Instructions 

The instructions for this assignment are divided into three parts: 

1. Scraping 

2. MongoDB and Flask Application

3. Submission 

## Part  1: Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb`. Use this file to complete all your scraping and analysis tasks. The following information outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scrape the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

```python
# Example:
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images—Featured Image

* Visit the URL for the Featured Space Image site [here](https://spaceimages-mars.com).

* Use Splinter to navigate the site and find the image URL for the current Featured Mars Image, then assign the URL string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Be sure to find the image URL to the full-sized `.jpg` image.

* Be sure to save a complete URL string for this image.

```python
# Example:
featured_image_url = 'https://spaceimages-mars.com/image/featured/mars2.jpg'
```

### Mars Facts

* Visit the [Mars Facts webpage](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including diameter, mass, etc.

* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the [astrogeology site](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high-resolution images for each hemisphere of Mars.

* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image URL to the full-resolution image.

* Save the image URL string for the full resolution hemisphere image and the hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Append the dictionary with the image URL string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Part 2: MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` by using a function called `scrape`. This function should  execute all your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the Mars data into an HTML template for displaying the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the Mars data dictionary and display all the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

## Part 3: Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter notebook containing the scraping code used

2. Screenshots of your final application

Ensure your repository has regular commits and a detailed `README.md` file. Then, submit the link to your new repository. 


## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use PyMongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
